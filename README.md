<h1># StreamGate</h1>

<h2>For LUKSO to successfully support the new creative economy, music artists need a seamless experience to produce assets (e.g. Music NFTs) connecting them to fans living on popular streaming platforms.</h2>

New web3 startups enter as loud challengers to the tech category, competing and fighting for market share with web3 and established web2 players. As a result these established companies play defense by denying the need for and (even banning) web3 and crypto. We believe in partnering to innovate instead of competing amongst our peers.

We feel this tension especially in Music. Music NFTs don’t have a place to exist in a meaningful way. Fans have two options: 
listen to web3 music on new platforms, away from the rest of their music, or 
download that music via token gate, and put it on a device, in a place that is still away from the rest of their music. 
We believe the disconnect between web2 and web3 music is an opportunity for LUKSO’s Universal Profile to improve the experience for every stakeholder and participant in the music ecosystem, through seamless listening experiences and benefits unlocked from artist-fan relationships.

<h2>Solution: Introducing StreamGate</h2>

**StreamGate is a dAPP that allows users with a Universal Profile to connect to their Spotify account and generate fan stats, enabling dynamic metadata changes to artist-created tokens. Our platform empowers all companies, artists, fans, and LUKSO by rewarding partnership and participation in real-time.**

Use Case: Junior Jr. (a web3 rapper) distributes a song through DSPs such as Spotify or Apple Music, and links the song through StreamGate to an LSP-7 token. He can now notify fans who have minted the token that streaming the song 1000 times on Spotify will unlock a limited edition physical T-shirt that proves they’re a true super fan. At 1000 streams, the metadata for the token will update, and give access to a token gate that allows for the redemption of the reward. 1000 streams equates to about $40 in streaming royalties for the artist, which will support both the artist and dropshipping costs of the t-shirt. 

<h2>How does it benefit its users?</h2>

Introduces LUKSO as a brand that advocates for music artists, starting with a universal profile that allows artists more control over their creative identity and assets
Enables music NFT utility beyond collectible or speculative value. Fans go about their daily listening rituals on their streaming platform of choice, while unlocking tangible rewards set by the artist.
Allows artists to drive traffic to their music, generate streaming royalties, and increase performance metrics (e.g. monthly listeners, followers) supporting sponsorship opportunities. 
Inspires deeper engagement in the biggest fans: join leaderboards, earn badges, and redeem rewards.
Empowers existing web2 DSPs to keep expanding and retaining their user base through accessibility, seamless experiences, and brand equity in advanced technologies


<h2>How it works:</h2>

Spotify’s web API does not directly give access to stream count information. However, by asking for the correct permissions, our app can run in the background of the DSP to actively record listening activity and then catalog it as streaming stats. This information will be paired with the recognition of a Universal Profile to create a unique user account.

Through the artist hub, artists will have the ability to create mintable LSP-7 or LSP-8 NFTs, which artists will be able to link to their music, using specific naming conventions that are relayed to the account when they give access to their **spotify artist** page. These NFTs will have the ability to make dynamic metadata changes when they meet certain requirements defined by the artist (1000 stream count, etc.), and unlock access to token gated rewards to be redeemed. 

Fans will need a Universal Profile to be recognizable to their favorite artists, mint NFTs and play a part in expanding the LUKSO ecosystem. The quantifiable listening data makes it easy to create leaderboards or badges based on completed challenges, total stream time, or number of minted NFTs, so that fans can set themselves up for future rewards as artists add layers of gamification. 

Future Roadmap:

Our submission to the hackathon starts with solving for possibilities using music data and information as it aligns with YJG’s current goals and pipeline as a creative studio. We’ve come to realize that the possibilities for this gamification and reward system can be applied to any user base on a platform with an API that allows for stat access and recording. We can link follower activity, viewing activity, and subscription information to dynamic metadata changes related to a specific token, and create reward systems that allow creators to grow their platforms. We believe building with LUKSO and its ecosystem will make this vision possible.
