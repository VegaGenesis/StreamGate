# StreamGate

Problem Statement: 

For LUKSO to successfully support the new creative economy, music artists need a seamless experience to produce assets (e.g. Music NFTs) connected to popular streaming platforms.  

New web3 startups enter as loud challengers to the tech category, competing and fighting for market share with web3 and established web2 players. As a result these established companies play defense by denying the need for and (even banning) web3 and crypto. We believe in partnering to build innovations, but instead we’re limited by internal competition. 

We feel this tension especially in Music. Music NFTs don’t have a place to exist in a meaningful way. Users have two options: 
listen to the music on random new platforms, away from the rest of their music, or 
download that music via token gate, and put it on a device, in a place that is still away from the rest of their music. 
We believe the disconnect between web2 and web3 music is an opportunity to improve the experience for every stakeholder and participant in the music ecosystem, through seamless listening experiences and benefits unlocked from artist-fan relationships.
